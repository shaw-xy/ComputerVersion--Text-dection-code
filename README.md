Cash Image Text Detection


This repository contains Python code for detecting text in an image of cash.

Overview


The code uses a combination of OpenCV and Tesseract to perform text detection and recognition on an input image.

Steps：


1.Load the input image using cv2.imread().

2.Perform various image preprocessing steps including grayscale conversion, noise removal, thresholding, dilation, erosion, opening, canny edge detection, skew correction, and template matching.

3.Use the EAST text detector to detect text regions in the image. This involves setting up a neural network, preparing the input image as a blob, and forwarding it through the network to obtain scores and geometry information. Non-maximum suppression is then applied to filter out overlapping detections.

4.Draw rectangles around the detected text regions on the original image and use Tesseract to add text labels.

5.Finally, use Tesseract to recognize the text in the entire preprocessed image and print the result.

Usage：


1.Install the required libraries: cv2, pytesseract, numpy, and imutils.

2.Set the path to the EAST text detector model.

3.Provide the path to your input image.

4.Run the script to perform text detection and recognition.


Most of all


Make sure to have Tesseract installed and configured properly for text recognition. Also, ensure that the EAST text detector model is accessible at the specified path.
